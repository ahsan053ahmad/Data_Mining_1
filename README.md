# Data_Mining_1
This repository contains the R Markdown output and project documentation for a data exploration case study conducted as part of an academic assignment.

### Business Problem

Data-driven decision-making often begins with a solid understanding of the dataset at hand. In this assignment, the goal was to explore a balanced dataset that could later be used for modeling purposes, with a focus on understanding variable distributions, relationships, and potential data quality issues.

The balanced dataset simulated a real-world scenario where class imbalance—often a challenge in classification problems—had already been addressed, making it suitable for unbiased model training. Conducting an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) helped lay the foundation for future modeling stages and ensured that the data was clean, well-understood, and ready for transformation.

### Project Objective

The project focused on providing a clear, reproducible exploratory data analysis using R and R Markdown. Key objectives included:

- Understanding the structure and quality of the dataset
- Identifying key features that influence the target variable
- Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in the data
- Creating a well-documented report that could guide downstream analysis

These objectives aimed to strengthen foundational data skills and reinforce the value of thoughtful exploration before modeling.

### Solution Overview

To meet the objectives, a systematic EDA workflow was designed and executed entirely within R, using a combination of tidyverse packages and visualization libraries. The workflow included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, inconsistent types, and outliers
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated univariate summaries and group-wise comparisons
- **Visualization**: Created bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots to better understand patterns and feature relationships
- **Correlation Analysis**: Used visual correlation matrices to examine the strength and direction of relationships among numeric variables

The analysis was written in R Markdown and output as an HTML document, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

### Business Value

Though this was an academic project, it simulates a critical step in real-world data projects:

- Ensures cleaner, better-structured data before modeling
- Builds intuition about which features may be most predictive
- Highlights potential issues (e.g., outliers, skewed distributions) early in the pipeline
- Supports communication of technical insights through narrative and visualization

### Challenges Encountered

The assignment posed several interesting challenges:

- Ensuring that data transformations preserved analytical integrity
- Visualizing and interpreting trends across several categorical variables
- Communicating findings in a concise yet informative way for a non-technical reader

These challenges mirrored the demands of real-world data work, where exploration is as much about storytelling as statistics.

Through this assignment, I deepened my R skills and strengthened my confidence in preparing data for future modeling and analysis.
